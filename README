My personal vim configuration.

I'm using vundle to manage the plugins, and trying to not
add too many of them. I wanna get acquainted with the ones I already have
before installing others.

I have added some keymaps to handle splits in a way similar to the
Terminator terminal emulator for linux, and tabs as well.

Hope you'll enjoy.

Vincenzo
